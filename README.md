# C++ OOP Concepts 🚗💻

This repository contains simple and clear examples demonstrating the core concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in **C++**.

## 📚 Topics Covered

1. **Class and Object**
   - Understanding the blueprint vs. instance
   - Example: `Car` class with properties and functions

2. **Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Binding)**
   - Function Overloading
   - Operator Overloading

3. **Run-Time Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding)**
   - Inheritance
   - Virtual functions
   - Function overriding

4. **Abstraction**
   - Hiding implementation details using abstract classes
   - Example: `Camera` with `clickPicture()` function
